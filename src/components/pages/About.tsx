                Hello I'm Justin graduted at Trisakti University, Strong professional with a Bachelor's degree focused in Engineering from Trisakti University.
            </p>

            <p>
                I have completed the Fullstack Web Development bootcamp at Synrgy Academy, where I mastered programming languages such as React, HTML, CSS, Python, and JavaScript. I have hands-on experience with PostgreSQL for database projects.

                I employ Bootstrap as my primary CSS framework and have developed projects using Express.js and Node.js. I'm proficient in deploying applications, utilizing platforms like Vercel and Koyeb.

                Driven by a deep passion for programming, I am eager to further explore this dynamic field. Please feel free to reach out to discuss programming, collaborate on web or mobile projects, or explore opportunities for partnership.

                I am actively seeking new opportunities in programming and would be thrilled to hear from anyone looking to offer me a position in this exciting field.
